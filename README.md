# Expense Control

Little system to control finances.

## Goals
- Use Java to remember some stuff
- Replace my current finances excel spreadsheet
- Use Docker to learn how to dockerize a Java App.
- Maybe open production to public HTTPS Access to learn all stuff required to do so (SSL, Load balancing, backups, DevOps, etc.)
